# Cryptography-Algorithms-Implementation
A C/C++ library implementing three fundamental cryptographic algorithms: One-Time Pad (OTP), RC4 stream cipher, and Vigenère cipher. Designed for educational purposes and lightweight security applications, this project provides clear, documented implementations of these classic ciphers with proper key management and encryption/decryption workflows. The OTP implementation demonstrates perfect secrecy when used correctly, while the RC4 and Vigenère components showcase stream and polyalphabetic cipher techniques respectively. Includes test vectors and usage examples for verification. Ideal for students learning cryptographic concepts or developers needing reference implementations
